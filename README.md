## Project name 
Protect Farm From Elephants
## Description
This is my course project for independent Game Development Project Course which is part of my master studies. Main intention is to continue practicing game development with Godot4 engine and C#. At the same time, I practice digital drawing because I intend to draw all Pixel Art assets on my own.
This 2D, tilemap-based game is about a mouse who is one and only employee on a farm owned by a cat who is sweet tooth and has intense desire for fruits but is too lazy to grow them. The mouse needs to take care of the plants and manage to 
grow specific amount in each level in specific time or else it gets eaten by the cat. However, this farm is unfortunately located next to travel path of a herd of elephants who are not hostile on purpose, they just happen to destroy 
some of the crops while walking past the farm. Thus, player has to use creative upgrade items to protect the crops and feed the angry boss.
## How to run the project 
This project is not yet fully functional but it is downloadable.
## Learning goals with this project
- learn game design and development practices
- learn godot4 game engine and C#
- improve my skills in how to apply object-oriented programming into game development
- learn digital drawing with Krita
## Project status
This is currently ongoing project I am developing individually for my studies. It is not even close to be neat and perfect playable game, but I still want to demonstrate my honest learning journey.
